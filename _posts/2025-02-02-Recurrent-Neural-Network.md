Traditional machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression and multilayer perceptron, are not equipped to solve previous information and utilize it for predictions. These algorithms do not have the capability to retain information from prior inputs. Here, recurrent neural networks come into a play, which is capable of retaining prior information and utilizing it for making accurate predictions.
